Creating an Internet Archive presence for the Weston Historical Museum


The museum's holdings are **a collection of collections**, and require some up-front planning.  This helps ensure your **Internet Archive presence** is well-structured, searchable, and scalable. Here's a  roadmap to follow before contacting the Internet Archive or upload anything:

---

## 🗂️ Step 1: Define Top-Level Collection Structure

Since your **museum collection is a collection of collections**, you’ll want one **primary collection** (e.g., "Eastville Historical Museum") that contains **sub-collections** such as:

* **Artifacts** (photos, scans, descriptions of physical items)
* **Archival Photos**
* **Genealogy Records**
* **Historic Documents**
* **Oral Histories** (optional, if you have audio/video)
* **Recordings
* **Videos

### 🧩 Structure Example (on Archive.org):

```
Main Collection:
  /Eastville Historical Museum/
    → /Artifacts/
    → /Photographs/
    → /Genealogy/
    → /Documents/
    → /Oral Histories/
```

Each of these sub-collections will have:

* Their own metadata
* Their own search filters
* Their own page on the Internet Archive

> ⚠️ Note: The Museum can upload 'Items' to the IA but 'Collections' and 'sub-collections' are created by the Internet Archive staff.

## 📋 Step 2: Prepare a Proposal for Internet Archive Staff

When you're ready to contact them, send a **structured proposal**. Here's what to include:

### 📧 Example Proposal Outline:

**Subject:** Collection Setup Request — \[Museum Name]

**Message:**

> Hello,
>
> I represent the \[Full Museum Name], a small historical museum in \[City, State]. We are beginning a digitization project and would like to host our materials on the Internet Archive.
>

>
> This would contain the following **sub-collections**:
>
> * **Artifacts**: Photographs and documentation of physical items (tools, textiles, etc.)
> * **Archival Photographs**: Historical photographs with metadata (date, subject, location)

## 📁 Step 3: Organize Local Metadata & Files

For each item or document you want to upload later, prepare basic metadata in a spreadsheet or shared doc:

| Title      | Description                              | Date | Collection | Format | Subject Tags                     | Donor/Source   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1873 Quilt | Handmade quilt from the Jordan family... | 1873 | Artifacts  | JPEG   | textiles, quilting, 19th-century | Donated by ... |

This helps you stay consistent across uploads and makes bulk processing easier if you use automation tools later.

## ✅ Step 4: After Approval

Once Archive staff creates your collections, you’ll:

* Upload individual items
* Assign them to the appropriate **sub-collection**
* Add detailed metadata
* Optionally embed them into your museum’s website
