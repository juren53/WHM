Let the reader imagine himself perched sixty feet above the water in the pilothouse, which is a good-sized box, usually ten or fifteen feet square, built up high above the cabins of the boat, and somewhere near its center. This lofty aerie is enclosed upon all sides with glass windows, so that the pilot at the wheel, which is a big thing, may see both shores and up and down the river. Our pilot is surrounded by speaking tubes, and bell ropes. There are two engines, so that there are duplicate bell ropes. They signal “stop her”; “go ahead”; “back her”; “slow”; “fast,” and what not, so that although fifty feet or more of space and half a dozen decks separate the pilot from the engineer, yet they are as one man, or one is the double of the other.

bell ropes—Also known as bell cords, they were wooden-handled or brass-ringed cords strung from the ceiling of the pilothouse. The pilot used them to signal the engineer to stop, come ahead, or reverse the engine. Sidewheel boats had two sets of bell ropes—one for each engine.

A rendition by the 'iron orchestra' in the engine room is all the more impressive when accompanied by the clear, silvery ringing of the oldtype engine bells. There was something indefinable put in the tones of those bells; they are unforgettable. Of the many times that the writer had heard engine bells, the best effect was to hear from the shore when the boat was coming in to a landing and when the far-off tinkle of those bells came like a song over the water—the slow bell—the stopping bell—according to conditions of landing.
