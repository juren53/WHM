A description of the sounds of a steamboat:

---

The era of the packets is nearing a fadeout, and the last of the old steamers may be the last of the time. Though the light and romance of packet boating faded along with the freight and vanishing affluence of the river, there is still some demand for that class of travel, as attested by the patronage of these remaining packets. Steamboats may come and go, but the beauty and charm of the river stand fast.

Before these last survivors of a brilliant epoch of transportation pass into history, there should be recorded the sounds in the engine rooms and the throb of engines in perfect cadence with the rocket-like roar through the smokestacks. Like a measured beat in a symphony, the sound goes on and on in the same tempo while the boat is underway, restful as the sigh of a summer breeze.

A rendition by the iron orchestra in the engine room is all the more impressive when accompanied by the clear, silvery ringing of the old-type engine bells. There was something indefinable put in the tones of those bells; they are unforgettable. Of the many times that the writer had heard engine bells, the best effect was to hear from the shore when the boat was coming in to a landing and when the far-off tinkle of those bells came like a song over the water—the slow bell—the stopping bell—according to conditions of landing.
