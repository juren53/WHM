## Creating an Internet Archive presence for the Weston Historical Museum


The museum's holdings can be viewed as **a collection of collections**, and require some up-front planning to create an **Internet Archive (IA) presence**.  This approach helps ensure the Museum's **IA presence** is well-structured, searchable, and scalable. 

Here's an approach to consider:

## üóÇÔ∏è Step 1: Define a Top-Level Collection Structure

Since your **museum collection is a collection of collections**, you‚Äôll want one **primary collection** (e.g., "Eastville Historical Museum") that contains **sub-collections** such as:

* **Museum Artifacts** (photos, scans, descriptions of physical items)
* **Photo Archive**
* **Local Genealogy Records**
* **Historic Documents** (maps, blueprints, gov't records, deeds, etc.)
* **Oral Histories**
* **Recordings
* **Videos

### üß© Structure Example (on Archive.org):

```
Main Collection:
  /Eastville Historical Museum/
    ‚Üí /Artifacts/
    ‚Üí /Photographs/
    ‚Üí /Genealogy/
    ‚Üí /Documents/
    ‚Üí /Oral Histories/
```

Each of these sub-collections will have:

* Their own metadata
* Their own search filters
* Their own page on the Internet Archive

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The Museum can upload 'Items' to the IA but 'Collections' and 'sub-collections' are created by the Internet Archive staff.

## üìã Step 2: Prepare a Proposal for Internet Archive Staff 

When we're ready, we can send the **Internet Archive** a **structured proposal** to set up the Museum's collections. Here's what to include:

### üìß Example Proposal Outline:

**Subject:** Collection Setup Request ‚Äî \[Museum Name]

**Message:**

> Hello,
>
> I represent the \[Full Museum Name], a small historical museum in \[City, State]. We are beginning a digitization project and would like to host our materials on the Internet Archive.
>
> We‚Äôd like to create a **primary collection** titled:
> **\[Museum Name] Digital Archive**
>
> This would contain the following **sub-collections**:
>
> * **Artifacts**: Photographs and documentation of physical items (tools, textiles, etc.)
> * **Archival Photographs**: Historical photographs with metadata (date, subject, location)
> * **Genealogy Records**: Family trees, census transcriptions, church registries
> * **Historic Documents**: Letters, town meeting minutes, deeds, etc.
> * **Oral Histories** *(if applicable)*: Audio interviews with residents
>
> Our account username is: `[your Archive.org username]`
>
> We are a registered nonprofit and have a website: \[your website]
>
> Please let us know how best to proceed. Thank you!
>
> Best regards,
> \[Your Name]
> \[Your Role]
> \[Museum Name]
> \[Contact Info]

## üìÅ Step 3: Organize Local Metadata & Files

For each item or document you want to upload later, prepare basic metadata in a spreadsheet or shared doc:

| Title      | Description                              | Date | Collection | Format | Subject Tags                     | Donor/Source   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1873 Quilt | Handmade quilt from the Jordan family... | 1873 | Artifacts  | JPEG   | textiles, quilting, 19th-century | Donated by ... |

This helps you stay consistent across uploads and makes bulk processing easier if you use automation tools later.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: After Approval

Once IA staff creates our collections, you‚Äôll:

* Upload individual items
* Assign them to the appropriate **sub-collection**
* Add detailed metadata
* Optionally embed them into your museum‚Äôs website

---

Possible next step: begin designing metadata templates for each sub-collection.  Possibly use spreadsheet as a design tool.
